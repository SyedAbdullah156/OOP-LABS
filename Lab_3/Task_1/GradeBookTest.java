/*Develop a GradeBook class that instructors can use to maintain studentsâ€™ grades on an exam and display a grade 
report that includes the grades, class average, lowest grade, and the highest grade. This version of class GradeBook
 stores the grades for one exam in a one-dimensional array. Assume 10 students in each course.
Demonstrate the capabilities of the GradeBook class to present the data in a tabular format for few courses in your
 ongoing semester without using array of objects approach.
